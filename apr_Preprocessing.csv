B07232M876,AGNONTMQDE5KLLDEEB57Z3C5WAEA,SD1908,R177X9L6ND6OA7,4.2,Execellent,Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car,199,395,50,92595
B07232M876,AFW6NV5N3FUXV3CNUACPSYC5AB3Q,Mukundha2good,R2YU5RDRT44DE6,4.2,Sturdy micro USB cable for Old phones,Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob,199,395,50,92595
B07232M876,AEW6KBDGJEWIOQKAW3FP74GMV6TA,manjunath h,R1K5FLRLAUZLKF,4.2,Super,I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility,199,395,50,92595
B07232M876,AEGT7WPGXXMSH5J3LZLL6CPJ7QMQ,Vidhi Nigam,R1HAZS2PLM3RRQ,4.2,Product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance,199,395,50,92595
B07232M876,AEKCUG7WMX6KMP6VFBWI3ICW5CBQ,Amazon Customer,R3EX1BCG3VPANF,4.2,Good,I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable,199,395,50,92595
B07232M876,AF2544C4RGIBQX7Y4JMKMSMXMRRQ,Tarun Gupta,R1C72DNWTJGUI2,4.2,Excellent quality cable,there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here,199,395,50,92595
B07P681N66,AHDFR3PDKEBV72HXRL3RJJLS3YYA,Anonymous,R2GUL8IL005EGF,4.4,Works flawlessly on Ubuntu 22.04 (if installed correctly),I am using this on an old Mac Mini,1199,2199,45,24780

B0711PVX6Z,AGNONTMQDE5KLLDEEB57Z3C5WAEA,SD1908,R177X9L6ND6OA7,4.2,Execellent,Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car,179,500,64,92595
B0711PVX6Z,AFW6NV5N3FUXV3CNUACPSYC5AB3Q,Mukundha2good,R2YU5RDRT44DE6,4.2,Sturdy micro USB cable for Old phones,Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob,179,500,64,92595
B0711PVX6Z,AEW6KBDGJEWIOQKAW3FP74GMV6TA,manjunath h,R1K5FLRLAUZLKF,4.2,Super,I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility,179,500,64,92595
B0711PVX6Z,AEGT7WPGXXMSH5J3LZLL6CPJ7QMQ,Vidhi Nigam,R1HAZS2PLM3RRQ,4.2,Product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire.,reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance,179,500,64,92595
B0711PVX6Z,AEKCUG7WMX6KMP6VFBWI3ICW5CBQ,Amazon Customer,R3EX1BCG3VPANF,4.2,Good,I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable,179,500,64,92595
B0711PVX6Z,AF2544C4RGIBQX7Y4JMKMSMXMRRQ,Tarun Gupta,R1C72DNWTJGUI2,4.2,Excellent quality cable,there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here,179,500,64,92595
B082T6V3DT,AFWJSD4AVIM6DC3YA63G2QPENQSQ,Arun verma,R1Q0PEVL6X8WZJ,4.3,Good product but costly,It cost should be under Rs. 500,799,2100,62,8188

B07MKFNHKG,AEOFYPCJJQYCKISUR6EC66IZH23Q,Yousuf,R1P8SL54VCWSMQ,4.2, otherwise a good deal,I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall,6999,12999,46,4003

Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price,115,499,77,7732
B08R69VDHT,AFYCBABBI2GCQRSCKIRHPLQNO72A,Amazon Customer,R1WGHB13Q2OLYA,4,supports 2.4 amps fast charging,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that,115,499,77,7732

B09RWZRCP1,AEVJIJSEUXPBRKOQ2PB4JNBUTFRA,Anand k.,R1PYVXH6MGUQLU,4.1,Charging speed is not guaranteed!,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,399,999,60,1780

I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4.

It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies,24999,31999,22,34899

I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home,24999,31999,22,34899

Bought the TV as already have the TCL s6500 32 inch model back in 2018 when it is launched and tv is working flawlessly and since did not encountered any issue so bought this brand tv again when required second TV.Improvement :-1.

B09YL9SN9B,AFQRUDMIIMRA32Y3JBUQNWFREEUQ,Manjunath,R3FXNMZ5WCRVBB,4.3,Super 👌 👍,I opted for this TV.  I have been using this TV for 3 months now.  Below are my observations when using this TV as a secondary TV or gaming TV.Pros:1.  This TV comes with the software from the bigger OLED TV of LG meaning,15990,23990,33,1035
B09YL9SN9B,AGSMSIDW4O7QLQGWYZQQMDHWGR4Q,Priyanka Mukherjee,RQAJZR3HP1BF8,4.3,Nice,to some extent better upscaling.2.  Since I am using primarily as a gaming TV,15990,23990,33,1035
B09YL9SN9B,AED3V5KQXHYOPY3IL2CUQITIZFHQ,Krishti jaswani,R1W0S8Y1MEZEOL,4.3,It's amazing with this price 15.5K.,I love the Game mode.  You can truly see the difference when you play with and without Game mode.  Pic and responses are shaper and faster with Game mode active.3.  You can connect Bluetooth headset to TV.  Great when watching movies as a secondary option.4.  LG service is the best!!!  The come probably the next day,15990,23990,33,1035

B09RX1FK54,AEVJIJSEUXPBRKOQ2PB4JNBUTFRA,Anand k.,R1PYVXH6MGUQLU,4.1,Charging speed is not guaranteed!,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,399,999,60,1780

Had to buy this as for some weird reason the amazon firestick (bern working for 3 years) is no longer working when connected to my Samsung TVs HDMI port (all 4 ports). Searching in google did not help as this issue seem to be common with Samsung TVs but with no possible solution. So wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the HDMI slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable. The firestick worked well with monitor. What's even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same Samsung TV using this cable. Problem solved,229,595,62,12835

The magic remote costs around 3k approximately.Display: when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dots.Immediately called up Amazon first and then we scheduled a tech visit.The tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked what's the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with it.So i waited for 2 days again and nothing was showing up on Amazon app about replacement so doubting it I called up Amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and i was given another date within 4 days.This time the replacement came and was good.,30990,49990,38,1376

B0BB3CBFBM,AEAKVP53B3LBTLJOVAQZUWEF6PYQ,Venkatesh,R38QJJVHQYT7R3,4.1,Satisfied,Got it at 19k in the sale. The TV uses WebOS. its snappy. its so so feature rich. The magic remote is amazing. It supports Samsung Smartview and DEX out of the box which means without any internet and wifi etc you can directly cast your screen. Super handy. The sound quality is just so so great for the price. The Remote gets synced with the Airtel DTH and there is dual band support. The HDR gets detected and auto upscaled for Full HD contents in the Hotstar and Netflix. The only cons I find is the power usage which is 100Watt and the smart assistant is pretty useless. The WebOS btw has all essential apps.About VU: Installation is done same day. i cant comment on the durability and future support now. But thats common for all TV comps today except Samsung,29990,65000,54,211

B081FG1QYX,AEH3VHBR2ECN647RYG3VNMASKBWA,Sirajdurvesh,RIAQUZT21P6N1,4.3,I bought it for my bike,I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use,339,999,66,6255
B081FG1QYX,AEZCPNPTW4BIFN7P2QFA3ML4ZKUQ,Adhikundhan,RFIJDX0AGS6ZR,4.3,Excellent,the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ₹300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality,339,999,66,6255

But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved.

B07MDRGHWQ,AEOFYPCJJQYCKISUR6EC66IZH23Q,Yousuf,R1P8SL54VCWSMQ,4.2, otherwise a good deal,I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall,5699,11000,48,4003

B095JQVC7N,AG7MREPON3XAAGY4WT4YGA7DZWCA,Mahore.lakhan,R3OCQ19TZWHSN5,4.1,Good,and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,42999,59999,28,6753

This makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor. I have been using it for the past 2 months and haven't faced any issue.Another problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only. But replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for meFinal verdict: good monitor wall mount easily taking 5kg of weight on it.Could have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be more,399,799,50,1161

This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use,339,999,66,6255

Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality,339,999,66,6255

Amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with a policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects. 2 stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking. I could see that they were holding the TV panel while getting the TV out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they weren't. Also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the Screen.Howerver very satisfied with the Sony Installation.

I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it.

There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV.

B095JPKPH3,AG7MREPON3XAAGY4WT4YGA7DZWCA,Mahore.lakhan,R3OCQ19TZWHSN5,4.1,Good,and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,61999,69999,11,6753

B0B5B6PQCT,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,AV,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,3.8,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5B6PQCT,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,Mathan kumar,R23WEMNZK46UV3,3.8,Best for the budget 👍,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5B6PQCT,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,Amol Manjrekar,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,3.8,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5B6PQCT,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,Suraj_nirmalkar,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,3.8,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5B6PQCT,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,ASIF ANSARI,RY95PJLUIT03E,3.8,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve,1999,7990,75,17831

B0BMGB3CH9,AGOWF5LLDDKUJTPYF4WOO5RKT4JA,Vishnu VP,R2RDC6R09NZ0TZ,4.2,Get it with bundled discounts.,It's original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles. The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v,9499,11999,21,284

B0BMGB2TPR,AGOWF5LLDDKUJTPYF4WOO5RKT4JA,Vishnu VP,R2RDC6R09NZ0TZ,4.2,Get it with bundled discounts.,It's original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles. The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v,9499,11999,21,284

This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given.

B0B3N7LR6K,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,shreyas,R2HMU574902EOQ,4.3,Great device for the budget !! And amazing amazon service!!,speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer .

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,15499,18999,18,19252

B09RMQYHLH,AHKCM7P5EDDMQZBKYYE75CPAF7FA,RAVINDER RACHERLA,R20F4XL6H69YXD,4.2,It's good,I feel corners have been cut in various areas:JN1 sensor is not that great in low light. Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens. Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsung's new F23.Thermal management is very poor. Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high. Same is the case when camera app is opened/simple games on flipkart gamezone are played. There are reports on youtube of narzo50's camera shutting down on hot days.Above scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy.Speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness (upper treble),12999,15999,19,13246
B09RMQYHLH,AFDRB56L4VXGIQHGTVK7NJM3WSYA,Tamojit maji,R30J2L74QHTQP9,4.2,Battery is normal,instead sound like white noise. Earpiece volume is low. So is the speaker volume when on call. On the other hand,12999,15999,19,13246

B08ZN4B121,AGUFJYDE6UKS5WLQYUXYVT5OTWCQ,Shyam,R2U0MOPP5A6KMF,3.8,Do not waste your money!,I bought this product with the hope that it would be a good and stable selfie stick. But it didn’t help at all. .It is not suitable for large phones like IPhone 11 Pro Max . . Very clumsy and the tripod doesn’t stand at all. . Keeps sliding. .Had a very difficult time to set up the selfie stick. .,539,1599,66,14648
B08ZN4B121,AHOQDY4AERBRQUTZNXDGE4VONOZA,Tushar,RPZFZ77ZCT4IM,3.8,stable only till half opening,Pros :1. Useful stick - stable only till half length,539,1599,66,14648
B08ZN4B121,AGSNTULCKL7K3VTGVWZZ2LFC5MWQ,vahida,R2K55RM7YMMECZ,3.8, battery cost is very high (2 batteries cost the same as selfie stick),after that it shakes like crap2. Bluetooth Remote is given which is very very useful (infact necessary i would say)Cons :1.Useful only till half opened - after that it shakes like anything.2.Lacks a mount to mount any led flashlight for low light videos.3. BIGGEST CON : cost of 2 batteries is more than the selfie stick itself. Now as i have no money for going for a gimble,539,1599,66,14648
B08ZN4B121,AE7XNRKCIQXN2W5G667XOUMKDGGA,Kapil Chaudhary,RAOZT6IRRYUCQ,3.8,light weight and useful gadget for a family to have cool pictures,so i am using this as well as bought 2 spare batteries (costed me 500 rupees for 2 batteries). Although i must say that you can find the CR1632 - 3v battery (the one used in this one) - much cheaper than what i paid on either local ecom website or local shops.,539,1599,66,14648
B08ZN4B121,AFA6RD2OGIVARNPAOXV7MW7LSO3A,Kritish Ganguly,R2G7L7325PDXOX,3.8,The length of the selfie stick should be more.,one must have this tripod to get full family picturethe quality is upto the markand it is standing strongly with weight of phonebluetooth control is quick and clear,539,1599,66,14648
B08ZN4B121,AE7A3EKW57EKUTLWKEKWLVQV6RUQ,SARFARAAZ AHMAD,R2DJYKMFRAQOTE,3.8,Good,If you are taking photos with your family at home then it is good. But if you are a single rider and ride solo then its length is normal. You will get only half of your photo. It should be of such length that the rider can take a complete picture with his riding gears.Then it is good for the riders. My suggestion is that it should be more length.,539,1599,66,14648

B09T39K9YL,AEMQXD272M5OGFOTZDB3PBM2KSWA,Amazon Customer,R1QALRWVTEDXMH,3.9,Good Phone,but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used,19999,24999,20,25824

B0B5DDJNH4,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,AV,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,3.8,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5DDJNH4,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,Mathan kumar,R23WEMNZK46UV3,3.8,Best for the budget 👍,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5DDJNH4,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,Amol Manjrekar,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,3.8,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5DDJNH4,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,Suraj_nirmalkar,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,3.8,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5DDJNH4,AGDD5ACY3AGTMTVBQOC3DMUR6REA,ASIF ANSARI,RY95PJLUIT03E,3.8,Good product,but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve,1999,7990,75,17831

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,13999,19999,30,19252

But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past,299,1900,84,18202

B09WRMNJ9G,AHLYJKN3B45FGUXNLI7HBJRMQXBA,Dinesh Kumar,RB90KDMXOCCPZ,4.2,Best option in 35k category.,I am using OnePlus 10R 8GB 128GB more than one month. It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as under:Pros:1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case,34999,38999,10,11029
B09WRMNJ9G,AGU3XNDQ5OIFEYL6W7FGAB4QNOPA,Saurabh,R1OARKAJGLAKQ4,4.2,Terrific purchase,it doesn't feel like premium phone.2. I don't like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons,34999,38999,10,11029
B09WRMNJ9G,AFQQLWLDOYRTQWZETYX6CFXNEOJQ,BIDESH PATRA,R1N33NHFCLHH1Z,4.2,A highly priced smart phone.,if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000/- you can go for it.,34999,38999,10,11029
B09WRMNJ9G,AGJLSJO25FNAPTAMQITAMV2DTV7A,Prateek H,R3JL5MHXQ8MCFN,4.2,Can't get better at this cost. Review after one month of use.,Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously,34999,38999,10,11029
B09WRMNJ9G,AGFXSW2YQHNS2ZPAMQHQLDH5QBZQ,SHREYANSH KAPADIA,R38ZGFRJN3GTNB,4.2,Oxygen OS is providing poor experience,i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand.

B09WRMNJ9G,AFNQRKRC76QTV3ANYGVIX3WGB7AQ,Vinayak joshi,R1VN3PBKU8OEGA,4.2, overall device is okay.,This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although it's Oxygen os,34999,38999,10,11029
B09WRMNJ9G,AGJU6F3B6JF6P3W5KKTWBRLGQFRA,Zarafatima,R27ULMSJKIY5YD,4.2,Ammazing Product,it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don't go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that it's embracing to say its price is 39k.,34999,38999,10,11029

B0B5D39BCD,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,AV,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,3.8,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5D39BCD,AG7DTVYZDY2NWU6V2G4KSIB67TDA,Mathan kumar,R23WEMNZK46UV3,3.8,Best for the budget 👍,they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5D39BCD,AHNQJPSI4I23HHMRHCCCI7QOBK7A,Amol Manjrekar,R1G2C7XV8CAM7W,3.8,Value of money,still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI,1999,7990,75,17831
B0B5D39BCD,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,Suraj_nirmalkar,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,3.8,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch,1999,7990,75,17831

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5.

B07WDK3ZS2,AHKQFWVTWLZQYGV6ZA6OCY333SNA,Dileepkumar,R11VQG0J80EBFL,4.3, worth on that price.,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,20999,29990,30,9499

With 6gb ram octa-core processor and 128gb ram it's a good phone. However it should not be compared with other similar products available at higher Price because those products use different processors for which the price goes up. The camera is just a decent one but not very good.It depends what are you looking for. If you want a good camera with better processor then you have to spend more.

B0B5CGTBKV,AHPYDFW6Y3FIQGD2RJPBFF5QNVRQ,AV,R3EKLFGQGV02SG,3.8,Not Polished Enough. (Improving with updates),[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that,1999,7990,75,17833

B0B5CGTBKV,AHPOQQONRLZMHYLDKYP5SQOKRIEA,Suraj_nirmalkar,R1O1T0NB6M5CU4,3.8,nice product,fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch,1999,7990,75,17833

The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v,10499,13499,22,284

B09GFM8CGS,AF7B5AJJZP2WKRD74Z45L7YDOEHA,Roshan Renji Cherian,RCP907FSHW2CI,4.1,Best phone for below normal use,If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.,6499,7999,19,313832

B07WGPKMP5,AHWRZWPCTG6ICA7WTNLNNZXWFI5Q,siddharth patnaik,R27MK332LTT5KS,4.1,Above average phone,I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,15499,20999,26,19253

Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months,13999,15999,13,2180

Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,20999,29990,30,9499

(my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing,16999,20999,19,31822

My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,19999,27990,29,9499

B09LJ116B5,AEZR42M5D6YTRJ732HWXBM5YEGKQ,suresh gaur,R1GNNZDXKP43DG,4.1, design kinda boring though,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing,16999,20999,19,31822

Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven't tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months,13999,15999,13,2180

B08JW1GVS7,AHLQIXPRTNN5L6C3CBOUFKA5BJ6Q,SOHAM B.,R2ZE9NQLM0OD5B,4,Power beast with some drawbacks,Initial review post 1 month usageCharging time - More than 6 Hours with fast charging power cable & power adapterCharging phone - Can charge a phone 3-4 times(tested with 3400mah battery)LEDs - Utter waste. So mild that it cannot be seen from a distanceThis power bank truly delivers as mentioned. I was able to charge my 1+7T phone 3 times fully with still some charging left in power bank. It took around 1.5 hours to charge my phone completely. Absolutely amazing product at offered price,2179,3999,46,8380
B08JW1GVS7,AFJVOXOQOKVDW2MJ24CT2NJD6Q7Q,Marion Noble,RNZNVONK9XAL7,4,BEAST mode,you can go for this one. Also tried dual feature i.e. charging power bank & at same time charging phone and it works well no problem. Did not face any problem with power bank heating issue while charging phone or itself. Type C charging port for power bank is good so you don't have to carry two different cables and type A usb cables are hard to find.Few cons what I felt after using1. Charging cable provided along is of no use,2179,3999,46,8380
B08JW1GVS7,AELCTVZ7X3OEG62M4JR2TL2VCHDQ,J. M. V,RIZOHKWA7NHO4,4,User review,it does not support fast charging. Hence used fast charging cable for both charging phone & pw bank.2. LEDs is of no use from a few feet distance. As they r so mild to be seen from a distance. You will have to hold PB very near to actually see LEDs. Although not a deal breaker but definitely 1 star deducted due to this.3. Bulky very bulky,2179,3999,46,8380

B09LHZSMRR,AEZR42M5D6YTRJ732HWXBM5YEGKQ,suresh gaur,R1GNNZDXKP43DG,4.1, design kinda boring though,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing,16999,20999,19,31822
B09LHZSMRR,AFCR3Q2LBT2KWRN42AOROJEDECNA,Rinku Barota,R1ZDKQ5659C68H,4.1,Good,but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,16999,20999,19,31822
B09LHZSMRR,AENNEXWQZKHYRUEMUASXQG6O4GDQ,8826277722,R1IZDBZW18XJPH,4.1,not bad,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.,16999,20999,19,31822

Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well,2799,6499,57,38879

Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap",1399,2990,53,97175
B01FSYQ2A4,AGGM4C652EG6WSDEOWBQCR7UXG7Q,Shreyas,R3IM6TBVGY4SYQ,4.1,VFM,I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately,1399,2990,53,97175
B01FSYQ2A4,AFZ3S6RJS6RVOXVK5OAIT4AX76UA,Arjun Thomas,R236B8Q3BSGZJ7,4.1, Plastic build. Must buy,he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart,1399,2990,53,97175

B01FSYQ2A4,AGYX7IY6ZHCU2J6DXRW5SN6LGEVA,Anku kumar,R1AYA1JIHAVM50,4.1,Low in price but sound was high,"for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud",1399,2990,53,97175

As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly the product has merged with it. The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.It is ultra-thin as described by the company with acquiring about a millimeter thickness. This thickness can cope with the windows laptops as they are having the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen. This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid will not harm the screen,149,149,0,10833

Honestly I was never satisfied with any other product like I had with popio product. A big thanks to the team!Bonus is DIY. I never tried anything self before but after following their guide and videos I was able to do it right at first time.

B09GFPN6TP,AF7B5AJJZP2WKRD74Z45L7YDOEHA,Roshan Renji Cherian,RCP907FSHW2CI,4.1,Best phone for below normal use,If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.,7499,9499,21,313832

B0B3NDPCS9,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,shreyas,R2HMU574902EOQ,4.3,Great device for the budget !! And amazing amazon service!!,speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,3999,17999,78,17161

B08JQN8DGZ,AEHVGO7QNRXBJXCIN7ZS2IBKCMUQ,Aditya Mondkar,R2SLNJ664LBZS6,3.8,Decent but not that impressive,enough loud at 50-60% volume. Bass is also ok. Mic quality is also good in indoor condition. Receiver can clearly listen to you. I didn't use it in noisy environment or in outdoors. Company claims there is low latency while gaming,1299,2990,57,180998
B08JQN8DGZ,AGCTCXJXG6EKLF6ANAPIKPTAW75A,Pawan Sharma,R2PJGCDX444YME,3.8,Good purchase,i don't know exactly if it works or not. Sound & call quality wise it's good one..But the problem is with battery backup. Company claim it will give battery backup of 40 hours with case. 8 hours in single charge+Additional 32 hours(4 times charge via case) This is misleading. It only gives total 25 hours playback. I've tested it myself.It will give around 7 hours backup on single charge of buds @ 50-60% volume(if you only listen to music or watching video,1299,2990,57,180998

If you try to charge after 2nd time it will only charge the buds around 60%,1299,2990,57,180998
B08JQN8DGZ,AF4WE2MXXMQUPLKNPGCVP6N3K3FQ,Nishant Mridha,R25G45DJ52J2HV,3.8,Good for cost.,then it goes off. (After 1st charge the case has 48% battery left,1299,2990,57,180998

B08TV2P1N8,AHDTCW665XEPKY4WAUG3DREFCCYQ,Punyabrata Mondal,R1O3A2CX9YG69H,4.1,The rebel with a defect,Writing this review after 10 months of usage. First about the product itself.  It's sound quality is very good. Bass lovers will just love it. Average mids and high.  It lasts about 25-28 hrs with a full charge. Also tested on heavy rain while driving ( don't worry,1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AGPE4RKV5YRZPGLXQ46D7DMCFDLA,ruma pal,R1OPAHCYQF1OK4,4.1,Nice product,earphones were not plugged in.. 😂). It was on my neck. But there was no water ingress.Now the major problem kicks in . After 10 months left speaker was not working. So,1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AHDKSXMFH5GRBJ6QJAPSEKXC6AYQ,Alam,R1N6RV1W0LKGWB,4.1,Really good product,"I registered a complaint on boat website. They picked my earphone for replacement.  But later it was replaced with "" rockerz 255 pro "" instead of "" rockerz 255 pro + "" . Why ? Even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didn't provide me my model . Now I've to stick with these low quality ear peace. Hence",1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AF7PR2PDWUSBNAQWPFIBW4J5OHBA,Shaikh Raziya Irfan,R1MXGMA3JKL1YI,4.1,Awesome charging backup 👍,Try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre. Good luck.Edit : After having conversation with higher authorities on Twitter,1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AGAWIQ7HOF4I2AFI7CD5ENI7BCDQ,Panmei,RAHUCIL8N8IK5,4.1,Value for price,they replaced the same with my model .Edit 2 : from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product I was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot. So,1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AFF5TLCH4IYWCZK3FG64LZ4FHRHA,sharad Pathak,RCYPHGHZYUAAE,4.1,Value for money,again I replaced with the authorized service centre for flat ( no/ very low bass)  sound.  But the 2nd replacement is also same. I thought I've some issues with my ear lol 😆 . But today when I listened to my friends rockerz 255 pro + (same as mine but the retail unit) I was surprised and thankful too . My ear was not damaged . It had the same punchy bass and that signature sound which was absent from my replacement unit.So,1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AFR53YXK7LLTSYXP3UALTFVDQCAA,A.BASHEER,R37WU40YNTLIYU,4.1,Bluetooth service centre not available,I can conclude by saying the replacement product will not have that signature sound as the retail unit.If anybody has experienced the same please comment.Thanks,1399,3990,65,141841
B08TV2P1N8,AHO4LIQVYAUKT6MMF4Y7MN5Z57YQ,Amazon Customer,R2JHL897G4Y4LF,4.1,good quality,I would recommend it very strongly if you want a budget friendly gaming earphone sometimes may feel a lag after purchasing but after some time it works very fine but it also has some cons like the build quality my earbuds gone worn off by normal daily use as well as there rubber quality is not that much good also mic it is not that good but it is okay so it is the best earphone under your budget....If aman gupta is watching this review you may gift me a earphone 😉😅,1399,3990,65,141841

Sound quality is good. Fitting in ear is perfect which has been constantly an issue with other earphones I have used till now.I have doubt on its durability because its wires are kind of handle-with-care. If it is durable then it will be among one of the best earphones,499,999,50,92995

B07JQKQ91F,AEQJY72BUJBIQCYK6V7CIZFEGFKA,girishkumarlanka,R1OUTZ9YCQLAMM,3.9,Really Good one under Rs 500,The C50 HI is a budget friendly in ear earphone and it really comes at a great price.But the next version of these i.e. C100SI has more value for money factors.Like C50 HI has angled 3.5mm jack whereas C100SI has the normal one and i am not supposed to say this but trust me C100SI has the best best best and superior sound quality if I compared to C50HI.Though it doesn't have a great durability.But if your previous earphones were c100si and you are switching on these then one can definitely notice the difference between the c100si and c50hi although you can adapt the sound of c50hi in nearly about 1 week if you are switching from c100si.To be honest the c100si is literally best in all circumstances such like gaming,499,999,50,92995

B092X94QNQ,AG6UWS47VN74SMHL4KL57DEJMBIA,Alden Andrews,R1XW3BIC0SBBJY,4.1,A decent all rounder.,I came across this very feature-packed product. It seemed interesting - and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it + ANC. So I thought I'd give it a shot.First-day impressions - it's blown me away!Exhaustive list of impressions:1. DIRAC OPTEO: Balanced sound with punchy bass! Yeah,1499,3990,62,109864
B092X94QNQ,AHVRHERJSRHVM63FSTZZI5SRWFKQ,Bharat Gidh,R1WOPI53IJ9804,4.1,All good but multiple pairing is awful,and not booming bass.

B092X94QNQ,AGEE5MMSCUBGNWYJ3WY622OZ7Y6Q,Varun Jadhav,RP5AN5NRHB0TT,4.1,Good Product (but Not well-finished) at a Fair Price of 1599,you can literally feel the space opening up. All the instruments feel individual and sound separated. Fireflies (by Owl City) sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. It's really great for the price!  1.2 Treble and Mids: Clean and clear. The bass doesn't overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don't interfere with it (Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!).  1.3 Bass: Punchy and tight. I love how it fizzles in 'Bonfire' (by Knife Party) and how it reverberates in 'Turn Down for what' (by DJ Snake). 'Breakin' a Sweat'(by Skrillex,1499,3990,62,109864

After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS (maybe wiring cable) which stopped transmission.I contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr. Ankit. He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too. After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same. Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet !!,1199,3490,66,11716

It can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings. Ears starts paining after 2-3 hours use. Speaker cover is very thin. I will give this device to someone needy.Sound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due it's tight overhead band.

Features such as SMS (surprising since this is an LTE version) and notifications (this includes watch apps such as outlook) that require internet are only synced with the watch on e it is connected to the phone VIA BLUETOOTHI did not check other features as the main reason I ordered this watch was accessibility to notifications without phone.,12000,29999,60,4744

B004IO5BMQ,AGMFAVIBZTCLSNBIEME5SBNPIQ4A,Harsh Mistry,R2O8DIRX6ME9HQ,4.5,Good Buy for normal use in office,I'm writing this review.Battery (the most important one): 10/10 - It came with a single AA-sized battery (Clock battery) that worked from 1st April -  10th December which is more than 8 months.  Even though my usage was heavy (6 hours average per day) in a corporate job day of 9 hours.Look 7/10-  Amazing with beautiful curves. Though battery closing pane could have been better.USB transmitter: 9/10 - It's normal and can be carried inside the battery cavity.Switch: 5/10 - On/OFF switch is not handy,699,995,30,54405
B004IO5BMQ,AEWIIDMBKGRGGXGMHUDHSJRSYABQ,Naresh,R50QNWM2SDL2V,4.5,Stylish mouse,you need a long nail to switch it ON/off but is strong enough to resist a hard stroke when you force it to off with your nailless fingers.Precision and laser: 10/10: Precision is just what most mouses have which is accurate and the Laser is invisible (No annoying light in the bottom).Buttons: 7/10 - Buttons produce a slight noise on click and after a long usage the Left button is shaking slightly.Overall ratings: 9/10The main reason for you to buy this: Its battery efficiency,699,995,30,54405

B012MQS060,AGH2D3JCXGY6SY5ZWKOIDELCLUQA,Anirban Mukherjee,R3VOHGBLWI7YD3,4.1,Early impression comparing MK215 with MK270  - bit underwhelmed,I had been using a Logitech MK270 for a couple of years before a couple of keys started getting iffy (no spills or accidents). With an overall positive impression of Logitech's performance (compared to my experience with similar from Dell,1295,1795,28,25771
B012MQS060,AFK54CUHW2VKQOGOWQD432GXJJJQ,Arbaj Patel,RHFB5XTT2UM3K,4.1,Lagging,HP) - I decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact MK215.While I knew this would be more compact,1295,1795,28,25771

B012MQS060,AGTM5VJF6YXWQ6RW4Q4OUT2OCX3Q,Santosh,R3HDI961AWUXP3,4.1,Excellent,especially during WFH.2. Big point is the MUCH larger size of the dongle. This will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time I throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting. I never did this for MK270 and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop USB port. That dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping,1295,1795,28,25771
B012MQS060,AFI5C2KZCUJSWZLUFDDRAPMFJPSQ,UMESH LAHORKAR,R2W2JH4PRGQ6DD,4.1,Worth,which is not there in MK215.3. Neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off - MK270 had switch on both. MK215 mouse takes 2 AA,1295,1795,28,25771
B012MQS060,AF4FIRN7RPMBEFPQGRYS36ZJWW7Q,sirsa,R200U4666Y0M6S,4.1,To avoid lag,whereas MK270 takes 1 battery.4. Mouse is shaped different - lower arch and wider - which may simply take adjusting. Feels a little cheaper.While a real review can only be provided much later - seeing how keys/clicks perform over the long run (and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality) - while I don't have any complaints so far,1295,1795,28,25771
B012MQS060,AF4ZFHPSSQQNBOH2HMEA7ONW5GBA,Hemant,RIGD9PRAW6OA7,4.1, plug into USB port without neighboring connections,I feel paying a bit extra for the MK270 may suit many folks out there. Hope the review helps - will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with time.,1295,1795,28,25771

Really thought full design . Material is good .Smooth finish & the plastic helps keep your forearms on it so comfy.You could get it for 200 bucks cheaper from their official website though. The place for keeping your phone is good . The cup holder is a bit too small and only holds small cups of 200 ml . Water bottles / shakers can't be put there . It is a really solid table with great clearence 28 mm . I thought 25mm too would be ok but i would highly suggest 28 mm ones .

B098R25TGC,AGJE2YGFQDWL6E6O3XOBPQ3YJIHQ,akshay,R2OFHGGYIJGFUR,3.8,Sound clarity.,the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.Battery life : Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80% charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case - Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red & white to indicate pairing,1299,2999,57,14629

Could be better..,It's been only 10 days and used it to transfer 64gb for now.. so i have not used it enough..i would update this after some days.. my relative bought seagate onetouch (Its best competitor) so i would compare it with it..**SPEED**Multiple Photos (32gb): Got 105 mbps max but 95 consistent..Single file(4.2gb):Got 117mbps max and it was more or less consistent..The onetouch reached 133mbps for multiple big files.. didnt check it further..**BUILD**It is very sleek and lightweight.. for sure.. but it does not feel very premium.. it is plastic all around.. you can definitely feel the vibration of the platters while file transfer..the onetouch was very premium feeling..metal and plastic body.. and i could feel its vibrations.. but it was much less than passport.. ( the passport is slimmer and shorter than onetouch ... maybe thats why..**SOFTWARE**My experience has not been much good.. i could not register my product for some days.. the screen got white and did not show anything.. there is no free backup software.. you are asked to backup on gdrive,5599,7350,24,73005

This is the only reason  i bought this one.. otherwise i would no doubt go for the onetouch.. seagate drives tend to fail twice as much as wd drives.. so i could not take risk.. many claim seagate has now learnt from their mistake and d is falling behind by staying in the top spot.. cant say about the first sentence,5599,7350,24,73005

One doesn't expect true Bass from such small drivers.SHORTER VERSION:Boat Stone 650: Very loud. Loud and somewhat uneven bass. Mids are a bit supressed. Somewhat muffled midrange. Decent treble. A loud bassy speaker.Nakamichi Speck: Barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. Mids clearer than 650. Bass much much lower than 650. If looking for VFM rule this one out,1799,4990,64,41226

B00MUTWLW4,AH6LPYJT5UBJ7CIEWVHDCNQAGWZQ,Nikhil M.,R1AJ6U452B6VPM,4.4,Very very very good in terms of ergonomic,I bought it when I watched an instagram influencer showed this product and wanted to try hands on this.Quality wise it's really good and since it's made by Logitech which has been in the market from too many years in PC Accessories - so less doubtful about it's durability. The best features once you pair your 3 different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth,2595,3295,21,22618
B00MUTWLW4,AFG4CVSEFXYGJMIHZKX7JGGLCSZA,Quader,RAPJSV76BEX8A,4.4,Good keyboard but have some cons,switching connectivity is super fast - like you won't feel any lag in connectivity. The instructions strap helps to well understand this product. I bought at 2.6k,2595,3295,21,22618
B00MUTWLW4,AFEXNZMRCU4SZFDGWRO6P4CMOGRA,Amith Bipin,RZV4F09ALESRQ,4.4,Good For Daily Use,but I know it's price had dropped to 1.7K during Diwali Sale.Things I hate about this product -- I felt it would be light-weight but it isn't.- Buttons are rounded (but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great)- For gaming,2595,3295,21,22618
B00MUTWLW4,AEUTWNKAMWBUEKXPNPWLZAV2PASA,Preet Shah,R14QZDM2M04IAH,4.4,Easy to use,buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which don't matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys (it's always WASD),2595,3295,21,22618

B00CEQEGPI,AEVREAMLELSSIBFZAFMHJZHZOCEQ,karan,R8ZNW2WNUSCA3,4.2, average mouse.,it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the 4 star than 3 star rating) but I actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair (I'm an absolute unit of a dude weighing 120kg) and the keyboard wasn't affected at all. I'm genuinely surprised.First of all,1345,2295,41,17413

The missing keys fell out. Not off to a great start but I slapped those keys on (which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy) and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. No setup or 3rd party software necessary,1345,2295,41,17413

B09ND94ZRG,AE2QS54KQW357EMHTCIX34UBB2TA,Satish,R2AV9AKW9EB7C1,3.5,Great at this price range,Great quality overall in this price range.Bass is very low but not so low that it will feel bad.More of a balanced sound.If you use any app to improve audio such as wavelet it will almost feel like premium quality.Some points to to note:Mic is available in both the buds but will work in only 1 bud at a time. Whichever bud you will pull from the box that only will work.But if you use only 1 bud then any one of it will work  because any one of them can be used as master.You can use only one (any one of them) at a time and you can use it's mic for call,1099,5999,82,12966
B09ND94ZRG,AFGABX3WXI4C644LQXZZG4Z7NYKA,Siddhant,RWSKD0OJUSGQS,3.5,This propods are overall good .,touch controls to receive or cut calls. Or else play/pause music.But this dynamic use of mic have some bug. Sometimes this change won't happens properly and mic will not work or the other bud which is inside box may have active mic started so the person you are talking to will complain about voice is not coming. Or some time may be muffled audio.Put both buds inside box and then take out again to reset it and it will work again properly.1 time I faced error that even after putting both buds inside didn't make them off and they continued connected to mobile.I connected box to charger and the issue resolved.You can put 1 bud inside ear and other hold in hand and keep close to mouth to get superior mic quality even in streets where a lot of noise is or in the office where you need to speak in very low voice.Battery backup is almost same as claimed. You can watch movies,1099,5999,82,12966

B0873L7J6X,AGHTZ6M45GWLTAEPAMM6IEH2BXOA,(sic),R1N3LBU331N1YS,4.2,Far better then expected,Well I had a notion that cheap bt headphones could not produce good sound.. Well I was wrong.. N Im glad .. I use iem,1499,3999,63,42775
B0873L7J6X,AGVTW4CSK4PNN4WGW6E2UYMIBA2Q,Harshit,R2NMV5Q9AYU4RM,4.2,Dual Connectivity Not Present,in ear wired headphones usually.. Used sony skullcandy soundmagic kz.. M not gonna say its better then all of the above but u will be satisfied with the product.. Sound quality is awesome.. Bass is good not like in ear..but still wonderful and enough .. U cant have the effect of an in ear earphones bass quality in a cheap bt.. For that u need to spend at least 10k I think.. It has a passive sound isolation.. Nd its great.. Due to its fit and the foam half of the outer noise gets substacted just by putting it on.. Then the rest go out while the music is on.. Dual mode is good.. But don't think anyone would use the normal mode.. Cant use the phone eq on nt headphones thats a down side.. But u can use other third party eq or the eq in Spotify or saavn works.. The headphones itself might feel it could break cos all of it is made of plastic.. But feels like its a good one... And wont break .. The pads are soft it dosent hurt the head or the ear.. Used it for hours.. Been hearing from a lot of review about the sound quality of these.. But believe me most of them r giving the review after using it for the first time.. Headphone guide 101 u need to burn the drivers I mean u need to use the headphones for a couple of days to get its full potential.. And sound quality is very good.. Vocals are easyly separated bass is enough.. Treble is the right amount (the way I like it) sound stage is good due to being a on ear with big dynamic driver.. And u would feel the richness of the sound cos of the brand.. A better headphone is the one which creates good and detailed sound.. Not those who are loud.. So yeah I would recommend this over boat. And one last thing.. Due to it being only a bt headphone and no aux cable is available.. The sound quality deepeneds on the device ur using the Bluetooth quality and the amount of sound out put it can produce.. U can charge it with ur nrml charger if its 5v .. Do not use fast charger.. Been using it for two days now.. Need to burn them drivers more.. And will update on the sound quality.. And yeah the battery back up is really good have used it for almost 4/5 hours still 70% charge left.. It shows in the bt connectivity sec on ur phone.. At the end if ur looking for a headphone with a good premium look a well reputed brand and great sound quality do buy this without a doubt.. This r satisfactory very much.. Go for it.P. S Amazon delivery is really not up to the mark.. Even being a reputed company and all ow and another thing saw some complain about it being manufactured in china mine says manufactured in Malaysia.. Yes its a original one have registered it with harman audio..,1499,3999,63,42775

Double clicking within a month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomly.Edit 1The warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was a pain as it took me a while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect.

B09LD3116F,AEAJ3Z2IULDDDQC7KCSUIC62M3GA,Ramana KV,R36Y9I6V38K4CI,4.1,Excellent CCTV WiFi Camera made in India,Giving this review after using it for 2 months.I am using 3 more cameras from other brands which are China made. I bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. Wanted to buy this Qubo camera and give it a try as this is Made in India and from the famous Hero Group. The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observations:Pros:- Excellent in performance.- Accurate in motion detection.- Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons:- Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating.- The LED doesn't glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,2490,3990,38,3606

Get it!It is my second time getting this keeb as I had modified (foam+tape mod) and sold my first one which I had brought from elitehubs I was going to get it again from them but they lost my account from their server T_T which I had a few cashbacks balance on.Pro's: 1000hz polling rate! ( Confirmed and checked using USB Viewer by Microsoft)  Best RGB leds I've seen on a keyboard under 8K these things are bright & vibrant af  Great clicks especially for a linear switch  Decent enough build quality  Angled Usb C port at the side (life saver for  me) |  Feels great for typing and gaming  Looks great  Con's: There aren't any con's if you get this keeb! but just to be Nit-picky  1. I would say that the switch and keycap puller that comes with this board is better if not used as the quality of it a bit on the lower side and it has a tendency to damage switches while pulling them out  2.

Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well,2499,5999,58,38879

B08CRRQK6Z,AGWYUX5PXASNTNHQVVFV6P5QRFRQ,NADIA FATIMA,R7X57IG9SMZ9I,4.2,Good,but this one is similar in sound quality. Treble is nice and crisp. Vocals sound nice even at higher volumes. Bass is amazing - fills entire room with that BOOM sound. Watching movies and listening to music is much better now with these speakers.Used these for about 7 days and overall experience is good.-- Sound bar (not subwoofer) - Size is big considering this is 80W,4999,12499,60,4541
B08CRRQK6Z,AFAD7OCCGIXRKR3RT4KLNHPJKN7Q,balmiki sahoo,R2LRVWCRPJU2HW,4.2,Sound best Quality.,but for me this is perfect size as it matches my TV length and looks good.-- Subwoofer - Small and compact unit. Bass is amazing. Gives that boom effect in action scenes and when listening to music.-- Remote - Minimal but functional remote. Has all the required features in single click.-- Connectivity - Does not have optical SPDIF but that's ok as Coaxial option is available and mostly all TVs have Coax connectivity only. Take a look below for Bluetooth connectivity. Overall Bluetooth works very well,4999,12499,60,4541
B08CRRQK6Z,AGYB2YEGULFOWJP6KAAK37LUEPBQ,Faris Tkd,R14DQ7KNNHLJA2,4.2,Very good,except when you connect certain devices with newer hardware.I have a smaller unit installed in another room and always used to watch movies on that speaker unit. But after listening to this one,4999,12499,60,4541

B08Y57TPDM,AFUV2FBPZYYQYR6VJS2VCVPZTODQ,Tabish Tariq,R2MQ6PENPS15K6,4.3,Great,These are original Duracell batteries. My car FOB key asks for a single CR2032 so instead I put two CR2016 one over other like a sandwich. Works like normal. But you don't try this hack. I needed CR2016 for my FastTrack watch so I ordered them but tried the above hack for my car keys and it worked. Do not try this at home. Lol.Tip- when handling any kinda batteries make sure you don't touch both - ve and +ve side at the same time. It discharges the battery sooner. Handle it with a plastic tweezer or with silicone gloves.,116,200,42,485

B07W9KYT62,AHGPGK7X35WHOVKQHT3OCUQ7KJNQ,Josh Crooner,RS0YPV8CGGS8R,4.4,👎Disappointed 👎Review after 1 year 3 months of usage,I really liked this router for a smallish space. The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.However it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow. I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. It's the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a year's usage. And to make it worse there's dismal after sales service.I tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasn't stable. I think I'll finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. Hopefully I'll find a good maker .,2499,3999,38,12679

Only downside is that it takes a while for full charge(7+ hours) for 900mah AAA duracell batteries.

B0148NPH9I,AGDGOIKF2V3IFHQLZ7QSCAYQTRNQ,Tripadh,R17YPP58KBZRVP,4.5,Excellent keybaord,or paneer if you're vegetarian:I think this keyboard's performance will vary according to your use case. For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I don't regret it. Both of them fir very well into my work type and they've made my life a lot more easier.This is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasse(I checked). The keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries,2640,3195,17,16146
B0148NPH9I,AHQ6LZRLPWZRHXDESLTHYTIQPKVA,Philip,R2KAS4LGHND8IP,4.5,Very handy andneasy to use .. the quality is as expected from logitech,and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. The major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. Now I personally thought that I wouldn't be using this feature all that much since I was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. But then I realised that,2640,3195,17,16146
B0148NPH9I,AHNLTNUGEDFJQZDRMZTHFFEV6YHA,Abhishek Patil,R1R2V16C9M5EE5,4.5,Cool keyboard,I could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts,2640,3195,17,16146
B0148NPH9I,AE4ENCSAVBVYJVFC3GMNMRDSD2KA,Ankit Kumar Singh,R3JFQAZ34O319C,4.5,Not worth the hype,emails on my android tablet at the same time. Nowadays I can't stop using this feature since I have my phone,2640,3195,17,16146
B0148NPH9I,AEBRFXFON7LZTJCLJHVYUTGAG4JA,Dr Naqash,R24Z5Y8NGE1CA4,4.5, but manageable,tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. It is honestly very neat.The keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than let's say square keys,2640,3195,17,16146
B0148NPH9I,AEA7RJWIWRHGUYKUP6LJBPRSZCDA,Sohan Maity,R3QQUAIJT1HNL4,4.5,A Robust,and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion,2640,3195,17,16146

The battery life is too good if used without LEDs. With LEDs it will last around 2.5 to 3 hours only. Without LED more than 5 hours for sure. Dont expect too much bass and overal sound quality is good for what one is paying. Justifies he price.

B08S74GTBT,AFUWFYMER6VM4ARW5VTGF3KEYM5A,Hari,R3L08DWQKGHDK7,3.7,Poor sound,the audio produced by it is always dry with no bass content.  So either we have to connect it to a music system or have to use headphones which are harmful to ears in the long run. Recently when I was surfing internet I saw this product which looked like an old radio.  On verifying the details I found this fulfills my requirement and without delay I placed order.Zebronics Astra 10 is having excellent audio quality with sufficient bass and treble content  just  like radios of olden days. The hollow space around the speaker adds to the bass  effect.  If we rotate the set and make the speaker to face us,799,1999,60,418

B07WMS7TWB,AHHCE7SDKWRKQDLFXF2YNMGODDRA,ba_doh,RVSI68M0EPAVZ,3.9,All your questions answered in this review,"Somehow Amazon sucks when you want to select an electric kettle. There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad? Are they genuine?Probably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model - you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. That's the game sellers are playing these days - to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE: Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W - meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving !! My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 10-15 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 3-4 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH: Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2-foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22"" (slightly more than one meter) - which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4.  CONNECTOR:  This one uses a 6A plug - which is most common in India. Be careful because from >1500W onwards",649,1245,48,123365
B07WMS7TWB,AEJQ5PXFKFXUBKWMC5RYF2WLEZSQ,Asim Kumar Ghatak,ROQNJTEGAA7VN,3.9,Just fine for the price,most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking,649,1245,48,123365
B07WMS7TWB,AGZDR3Y6MNTBZRSP754LCZGHCLPQ,Deepak Sharma,R1YNME95M4J2H7,3.9,Its okay okay according to price.,it should have a 16A plug,649,1245,48,123365
B07WMS7TWB,AE4DHHEU4Y3LQBPIJKXC4IBXB4WQ,Ujjval Rathod,R17RLWB0UMGULZ,3.9,Good for winter times to boil the water,but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5.  CAPACITY:  1.7 litres as mentioned - though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 4-5 decent sized mugs of coffee6.  COOKING OTHER STUFF:  The ad says only water - but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS: Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad - and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE: I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1-year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE: Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES: This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle,649,1245,48,123365

Does the job of heating water fast and that's it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesn't feels sturdy.

B01GFTEV5Y,AEJMVHQ4LOSVJQ5BOXQREVQBC5RQ,Snt,RY4GOMU0VCJ6I,3.8,Good but slightly slow,go for this.Also buy thin induction compatible utensils. It takes a very long time for thick vessels to heat up before you can start cooking.As a primary cooking appliance,1699,3193,47,54032

B01NCVJMKX,AGTBYZOGBXCBMYG2AN7LT4WYRZRQ,Jagroop Singh,R2MP2RC761IOHP,4.1,Serves the Purpose,The lint remover actually removes the lint :). It is not a gimmick but an actual working machine. it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around. Using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference. I used it on 2-3 clothes and am very happy with the result. Let me describe the pros and cons:Pros:1. Very easy to use2. Removes any kind of lint3. it also removes lint that is not visible i.e. of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older. so your clothes look a bit like the new ones.4. lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleanCons:1. The process is very very slow. you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times.2. the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys. it may break if fallen on a hard surface.3. the cable length is very small. The plug comes off the socket easily. you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes.4. the lint collector comes off very often5. the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break.6. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lint-free which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it. you will use it once and will never touch it again. however,499,999,50,4859
B01NCVJMKX,AFDWZMVLTXWWCX2UZVGVO5JLXCYA,abhilash g.,R2ZSKNB3CB2RWC,4.1,GOOD TO USE but price is high,you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight.other than that it is a good product and can be tried.Thanks,499,999,50,4859

B078JDNZJ8,AFV4TP7EA6GRZX4WZUQTAFBWIR2Q,Amazon Customer,REILW6738EJTP,4.3,Good product.,I received a text from Havells for the installation of the product. The installation process was smooth apart from the fact that one needs to purchase a 16A three-pin socket (wall plug not included with the water heater). There are no installation charges and my only gripe with the water heater is no plug!!The water heats up very quickly (5 mins approx.) and retains temperature for good 4 hours. Light indicators show heat stages (Heating or Heated) Even though one will find many alternatives at better prices additional costs for installation and accessories should be taken into account.Bonus marks for getting the design correct.,3600,6190,42,11924

B00EDJJ7FS,AH4KRGUX424RRJAJL2N7BQKGC3XA,surykant gonarkar,R1I1N1NYQ2TMVX,4.2,No1,Over all I'm really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience. I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature. This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle. For example when I set 160°C then it is burning toasts and onions... When I set one step lower it is 130°C and it is not enough for frying :(((.Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware. And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges... You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle,3229,5295,39,39724
B00EDJJ7FS,AG73LD2KHD5QVU277LLIT3VMT7ZA,Monu,R3CZD69S9SFWJT,4.2,तेल गर्म करने में परेशानी,"and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside :((( The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so I'm sure the fault is in this philips stove... You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed :((( And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... I'm really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is ""pause"" button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat - It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off",3229,5295,39,39724
B00EDJJ7FS,AHSIPI7MVS5ICRZJW6FJEDI2TBKQ,VikramJit Singh Khaira,R3IRM4HQ0TXTJB,4.2,Good,"light up again and then find right flame again... Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is 'stirr fry' button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set :((( ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won't let you or let you to do only one '-' but not 2 times '-'. Why??? I don't know probably ill will... You need to first press ""manual"" button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press +/- and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press 'manual' and +/- to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it",3229,5295,39,39724

B07WNK1FFN,AGKKNM6BD3A6GKIOIIX4JJBDLDYQ,videv,R27191EB7KCEZP,4.2,600 W heating kettle with warmer & temp control,1. I have used it mainly for boiling water (knob turned maximum to right) so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings.2. It takes about 10 min for water to boil.3. Suggest Mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc (as I see some other kettles) .  It may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room.4. The stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but it's ok for the price.  There may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a C shape due to the C shaped half coil at base (funny design,1260,1699,26,2891
B07WNK1FFN,AFD4QMZGWAYTZ3UNBOFRY6VZ2RTQ,Vishal Rai,R3KKAMYDQAI5WH,4.2, half coil heating element looks odd,maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle).  The scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe.  They seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing.5. Given wide based cylinder shape,1260,1699,26,2891
B07WNK1FFN,AEWCCNZCVTSPJOV3Y5WKHQNKOMFA,Dawood,R3MSYM05H7OI65,4.2,Overall a Good Electric Kettle,it is very easy to clean.To be aware: The kettle does not auto-shut off when water boils.  Similarly,1260,1699,26,2891
B07WNK1FFN,AFIWLA4V26PMEUGOVI5YCG3P2CQA,arfaat,R1KCIHR6YIA803,4.2,Overall good.,the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off.  Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating (I haven't tested this though).  These are mentioned in the manual.  So this can be thought of as a warmer + boiler.  So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.Accessories: Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.  Given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated,1260,1699,26,2891
B07WNK1FFN,AEF43YVI4VWAPHIJ6PVL72WYMLZA,Mohit Sharma,R2RVRY8NZ4GKVX,4.2,Good Multicooker within budget,I would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way,1260,1699,26,2891

That could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itself.Final verdict: If you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price,1260,1699,26,2891

B01N1XVVLC,AEEWIC5Y6UOO3KA5O2RE5GMQMLDA,Sudhanshu Shekhar,R3EA9NKMCKHQUN,4.1, but not fast enough,I used this 13fin heater in a 12x 14 feet room with roof hight at 10ft.It tood 1 hr 30 minutes to raise temperature by 2 degree( from 14.4 to 16.5. Room was closed.I retirmed it. Bought Black+Decker 11 fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj 13fin.,9590,15999,40,1017
B01N1XVVLC,AEUWI5TDSKBQHOFTRMU3DHC36IZA,Manish P.,R387DPEXYRMJVW,4.1,Excellent product,Bajaj name in itself a guarantee of excellence. A very product. Heats up the house in no time. Like a boon to elderly people like us,9590,15999,40,1017
B01N1XVVLC,AHFGAQ7GJGA35TSLYKZG4NAUFBFQ,Purrnanssh,R37X1B6A8MRS2G,4.1,Very slow heating,This is my review after 3 days of usage. Firstly I feel I got a used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with a brand new unused oil heater,9590,15999,40,1017
B01N1XVVLC,AF6CQDSUJMPSM7YSYVXZ6KUMZVMQ,UMANATH B,R34OFX5U5EEJNN,4.1,A silent heater,on first usage you get a smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time. This did not happen for me. Anyways I just thought to see if all is good and hope it performs.The heater has very very slow heating. You need to run it at max thermostat and with full load 2500 or 2900 W and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth. I was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off. Thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on.For such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often. If you have doors opening every now and then,9590,15999,40,1017
B01N1XVVLC,AESIGIVPJE5SHWIW6SOEHVBHT5ZA,Dr.Susheel Kumar,R2RAGNI18M2ZT9,4.1,Easy to operate and the performance is good.,it will not keep room warm.Over all for the price it has I didn't feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heating.,9590,15999,40,1017
B01N1XVVLC,AGONHBXIF7DGPMNZ2LUIBBW3FHZQ,amruta rokade,R1ZKGW1E97R6UE,4.1,Recived room heater of only 9 fins than 11.,This clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at a very good price. In offline i was getting 13 fin model for 12k to 13k,9590,15999,40,1017
B01N1XVVLC,AFUKG7S3SXXBZ47G5JVMH7TN4L2A,Kalzang,R1PWCV334TATWX,4.1,It's nice,but here at Amazon i got it at Rs. 9799. This is very silent and heats up the room in 20 to 30 min.,9590,15999,40,1017

B00O2R38C4,AENFJF6M6ESZKBLJAMLVOZFCCORQ,Durratussharaf najmuddin,R2I80SWXJJ8NVS,4.1,Cleaning is problematic,The product mechanism is like any other exhaust fan in the market. I realized that the size of the exhaust fan doesn’t really have a noticeable impact on suction power of air.Nonetheless,999,1490,33,12999
B00O2R38C4,AGVNTYOKOFM4NNLYUW4PYVCGLBWQ,Athappan,RLJKQ3A9HU77X,4.1,Ok,its drawbacks are that because of the small space between the fan blades,999,1490,33,12999
B00O2R38C4,AH3ZXWK36A6T5DSP6ZNR42M6C44Q,Amazon Customer,R2LZZWYUQPL9MH,4.1,Good,it is ultimately impossible to clean any dust/oil buildups on the inside rods and the shutter walls. The only way to clean the aforementioned areas is from the posterior side of the exhaust fan,999,1490,33,12999
B00O2R38C4,AEEQ3N6TTKJ6KIQQ5GNDS7AHU7ZQ,Priyajit Samanta,R2KNV63N41W1CA,4.1,Good looking fan but motor fitted with fiber body.. Quality ok.,which is difficult to reach in most housing situations.,999,1490,33,12999

B0B2CZTCL2,AHNMGYFOR4DBIKA2RPCDIGULYQTQ,naveen,RQHLZKD65C2,3.8,Some defects but working as of now,The kettle looks sleek but there seem to be some design defects. The base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling. Then while pouring,1299,1999,35,311
B0B2CZTCL2,AFOF4HGAVUO67MEWEKCNWXUYNXCQ,lexia Jacob,R1LPNPFT8RUFN7,3.8,Using for morenthan 6 months now.,hot steam which enters the handle thru the steam sensor hole makes the handle too hot. i had to tape the handle to insulate my hand from the hot handle. The switch doesn't fit the slot on the handle perfectly and i also noticed some water drops condensing on the inside of the switch on the handle.I used a Prestige kettle earlier which had much better workmanship. But these are all made in China anyway. i have nothing against China,1299,1999,35,311
B0B2CZTCL2,AHAB3QEH3EXTX52TZYS33MFECVOA,Nisha devi,R1QAZXMA5885V5,3.8,Very good product,here with the Wipro kettle there seems to have been a bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by Wipro.This is a problem with shopping on Amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer. In this case,1299,1999,35,311
B0B2CZTCL2,AGG5B6TRVEJCNBBDIXG2BKPS6X3Q,Unknown,RZW6HFWRZFZSM,3.8,Cord length is too small,i consciously went for this option on the hope that it would not be a serious defect. Lets see if my hope is allayed.,1299,1999,35,311

B07DXRGWDJ,AFR4DPHPUUE5HOH5IDNMNRCEHKBQ,Amit Khiwal,R31T82ERD3ZMK4,3.8,Over Expensive product,Product is very handy but the water capacity is too low!Disappointed with the product's pricing considering its wattage and usage time. You can't iron more than 2 clothes before water refill.Since the mouth area is not that much,4280,5995,29,2112
B07DXRGWDJ,AH46L3MY3OLQQ4JMDKONNEEHZNLQ,Purple,R18IERM1VRE4RO,3.8,Handy,you'll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth.Steam amount is fine but design is such that you can't press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing.So overall do keep in mind before buying that it's only for emergency & travel purpose for de-wrinkling already ironed clothes.,4280,5995,29,2112

I mostly use it to make whipped coffee but I've also used it for mixing protein powder in milk and frothing milk / creamer for coffee.It is incredible effective for exclusively liquid substances like milk and creamer; I realized this after over-frothing my creamer one morning to the point of pure foam lol. After that I kept it in mind and I know to only do it for a short amount of time. Super easy to use,279,499,44,28

Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged. They told me you have to replace the pump it cost around 3000 .

The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst -> HEPA Filter. (The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left Corner)Second -> Active Carbon Filter. (The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left Corner)Third -> Pre Filter.

One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor. The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly. 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors - Blue (Min),8799,11995,27,4157

I ordered one more basket in black but unfortunately the finish of the product on the inside wasn't smooth. I wanted to store washed laundry in the second one but the basket's interior didn't have a smooth finish - had scratches and plastic sticking out that could damage delicate clothes. I returned the second one. I am deducting a star because my second purchase experience wasn't good. I might buy the same product again in the hope that I get a product of the same quality as my first purchase.Update after ordering the basket for the third time - The third basket's rim was bent so I couldn't fit the lid but the baskets finish was perfect.

Tap water has alot of impurities and gets stuck and reduces the life of iron. I have seen that myself with my other steam iron as it leaves small dust particles on the waterstorage area.

B078JF6X9B,AENQUXAACC6E53BRVBZPXCC356OA,Kindle Customer,R3TCEP7588ZBZ,4.2,Serves unlimited hot water instantly,"I bought ""Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue"" and I'm really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for ""Instant Geyser"" instead of ""Storage Geyser"".-Storage geyser's have a tank to store water and heat it.-For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-As it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-Instant geyser's on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waterNow who should opt for ""Instant Geyser"" and who should opt for ""Storage Geyser"" is the question ?- If you like to have a ""Shower Bath"" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for ""Storage Geyser"" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-Instead if we consider ""Instant Geyser"" of 3lts capacity for shower bath",3645,6070,40,561

B09M3F4HGB,AGSJ64KS4SFGZOJTR4TWAMQHNTIQ,Sunil Singh,RSFAK41WPQNGS,4.2,Not upto the mark.,Since I have tried Bajaj 13 fins oil heater,9495,18990,50,79
B09M3F4HGB,AETH7LKNVDPFD2WPRVL7WXXCQXQA,Thoughtful_user,RFTJVE897RMI1,4.2,Probably the best build in this category.,this 11 fin heater is not worth it. The quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as Bajaj.Although I am comparing it with Bajaj 13 fins still the room size was 12x10ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature. With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesn't converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible,9495,18990,50,79
B09M3F4HGB,AFDQX4OPUFUN56VXCWO54Z7O2AEA,Anuj,R5BPUDDXQP2LX,4.2,A good heater with some additional amazing features which make it a best buy,Bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good quality.Though I received 2 defective Bajaj heater ( physical dent on body) from cloudtail,9495,18990,50,79
B09M3F4HGB,AGILEHPBZZUJACQFI527X6HPPS2Q,Mamta,R1RNRZ1O5EQLX2,4.2,Not as expected,I have again ordered the same. Hope this time it turns out to be good.No company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product. Good luck.,9495,18990,50,79
B09M3F4HGB,AEAKW6XSSNBTTT2SHXRSIYJ3P2KA,Vikas,R2RPW3A6WAAR13,4.2,Nice product,I have used bajaj oil filled heater before. This feels more sturdy. I think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish. Although it’s a simple assembly but still I wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and I was concerned about safety.It makes the room warm quickly. Based on the power mode you choose. It will make the room dry. I have seen people using  water vaporiser alongside but on low power I haven’t felt too try in 1-2 hours of use.Overall,9495,18990,50,79
B07VZH6ZBB,AHRTYUKNV36J2ZEK4CKJMQOK4S6Q,Anuj Dhingra (Gadget Gig),R18A1K5678ELRR,4,Best for small Family,I have been using this Geyser for almost two months. it heats up the water in just 15 minutes and quite power efficient. Uses almost half a unit for two person. And if you leave it on for the whole day its around 1 unit. Very power efficient. And looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space. Go for it . You get all the pipes and Installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other models.,7799,12500,38,5160

I opted this one as this was cheaper then its Havell's counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all. The only PROS is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all CONS.I keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if I put on the geyser for 3 hrs. It does not holds hot water for long. I have used Recold,7799,12500,38,5160

B07F1T31ZZ,AH7YJB6PZG5KP4GCWMQCHRIO3I4Q,Vikhyat G.,RVLTVX5PB83WB,4.1,Good product for an average user.,I mostly have instant coffee but this time I bought some filter coffee from Araku Valley during my visit. I was not aware of the process that you can't have it like the normal coffee so I tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won't get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it. Then I went online to understand the process where I came to know about this coffee maker. I bought it for 2cup coffee which cost me 299/-. You can get bigger one also for 4 or 6 cup. You can go through the process of how to make south Indian filter coffee online. To me it does job very efficiently and finally I am able to have a good cup of filter coffee. Now about the product it's not premium quality steel but it's a decent one and it's very easy to use. You fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night. So to me it's a value for money if you want to try filter coffee.,249,400,38,693

B07JZSG42Y,AHYDKTW3WJO4HNGBHBOAFCJ3LOSA,Ronish,RN8Y9B2XGVMGI,4,Simple and easy to use,Purchased this last month. It's good as working fine for me. Size is bit small but you can easily toast 2 normal breads at one go. Just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side. Cord is bit small but it's good if you have plug near your kitchen. At first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear. Cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you can't wash directly under tap. You need to use clean cloth with wetted with water. You can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth. Apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill.,1928,2590,26,2377

B09WF4Q7B3,AEMUKHRIKGIUXS6PTQTYDTMGPNMA,Akshaykumar Navlakha,R376OUGP5M5AHS,3.6,Just OK. Less heating,1) 1380W is not enough for cordless design ( Quickly looses heat while usage & takes time to re heat - you often end up waiting for the unit to get reheated ! - Corded Design is better for 1000W range models.2) Though this Has continuous steam option -  this drastically reduces the usable time and once you return the unit to base - excessive water dripping issues can be noted. Condensed water flows down the base to the table !!!3) User manual does not cover all necessary details.Overall - this is NOT a well designed product. &  Not happy with Real life usage,1799,2599,31,771
B092R48XXB,AG33A6XPV67G77FOMXFCNTTPNT4Q,Vinit S.,R1TD8NMUP7Y7JR,4.1,Works as expected but some things can improve,My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro 2 for 3 days...1. The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don't mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup,18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AEOZ6IIJSUVKY2DNOQELNMP5IOQQ,Amazon Customer,R14MB9E0621MTM,4.1,I am using this more than 1 year,for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times,18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AHCYUIAHUVSXADLSWJDVSHMJFLJA,Milind Barange,RR23X5VXCOUKW,4.1,Overall its a good product,"it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it ""light wiping"" and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum + Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode",18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AHGEW4CMLQ7VCFGGWB3DZNZKG34Q,Aniket Bhoir,R37T5HQG9ZZLQM,4.1, very useful.Some minor drawbacks.,mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt,18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AH4RT3Y2GD6IHEFNW3U3YFR2GG5Q,Roy J.,RTID73IKA1G3K,4.1,Great for vacuum,and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it's important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats,18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AE3PDSVEERSBHPUPUMIXEGBQCB5A,RAGHU RAMA,R2H0S2S7BMUIHH,4.1, bad for mopping,esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don't even know where it has gone,18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AE5HUIXKA7KHNJP7S6ON4CEY4R4Q,Sridhar S,R1WZZ9OM0LBYFR,4.1,Good product.,it gets so quiet.Pros.* Battery life* Suction power* Noise levels* VacuumingCons* Mopping is average. It's at best can be called as light wiping.* Setup is bit tricky,18999,29999,37,2536
B092R48XXB,AFWLTMPGTO2JIFW3KVLCHQRKKT7A,Sukhdeep Kaur,R2Q28C8LX2Y717,4.1,Product service issues,user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* Once the device is confused it doesn't correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset.* Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,18999,29999,37,2536
